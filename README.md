1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
  I referenced the official JS documentation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  The biggest challenge I encountered during this project was completing the guess function. I had to refer to the JavaScript documentation to find out how to grab the length of the array. 
  Moreover, I also implemented the logic of the guess function wrong, instead of indexing the 'pattern' array with guessCounter, I mistakengly used the 'progress' variable. I realized this mistake after I finished writing out the function on my own, and had 
  issues playing the game. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   What are the differences between JavaScript and other front-end frameworks? Are each one used depending on the type of functionality you are trying to achieve or is it a matter of personal preference?
   What does the behind the scenes of glitch.com look like when creating a new project for each user? 
   How does the back-end connect to the front-end?
  

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  The first thing that came to mind while I was working on this project was to implement the 'pattern' array with random integers between 1-4. This would add another degree of complexity and allow the game to have more replayability.
  I also want to add a difficulty setting that a user can choose from, depending on how much time they have to play, there could be an 'easy', 'normal' and 'hard' mode. With each difficulty adjusting the timer for the tones/lights, extending the amount of buttons to press and remember, and adding/removing buttons.
